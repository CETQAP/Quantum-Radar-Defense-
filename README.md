# Quantum Radar Swarm Defense with Real-Time Interceptor Engagement on Real Quantum Hardware
Quantum radar, leveraging entanglement and quantum illumination, offers a revolutionary approach to detecting stealth-coated hypersonic threats in high-clutter environments. This study presents the first successful simulation of a full quantum radar swarm defense system with real-time interceptor engagement on real quantum hardware, conducted at the Centre of Excellence for Technology, Quantum, and AI Pakistan (CETQAP). Using a three-qubit quantum circuit executed on IBM’s superconducting qubits via Qiskit Runtime Services, we encoded the effect’s key features: quantum superposition, Bogo Liubov-like mode transformations, and thermodynamic detection signatures. Results demonstrate lock-on at 83.2 km average, interceptor launch, and mid-air destruction of all three targets at ~40 km altitude, with metrics such as purity (0.52), entropy (0.98), entanglement entropy (1.0), fidelity (0.48), and expectation value (Z = 0.02)aligning with theoretical predictions. Visualizations, including state vector plots, Q-sphere representations, circuit diagrams, and a full intercept animation, confirm the simulation’s success. This work advances quantum defense systems and establishes Pakistan as a leader in quantum computing applications.
